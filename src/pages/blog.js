Think of it as a traditional wallet that you carry. You keep the money secured in the wallet and only use it when you need to take out or put the money in. the only difference is that you need a private key or password to access your digital wallet. 
                                                                        </p>

Just like remembering your bank account number, you can use a crypto wallet address to track your digital currency.    
                                                                            </p>

If someone wants to send you Bitcoins, you can provide them with your crypto wallet address. This is a great way to secure your finances because nobody else but you will be able to access your digital funds.

                                                                            Most notably, the interest rate hikes in the last few months that helped curb inflation has negatively affected crypto coins' value. Investors lost confidence in this digital asset and soon withdrew their investments.
                                                                            <p className="fs-18">According to a survey by Financial Times, more than 70% of economists believe that the US economy will witness a recession in 2023. A recession means that the country's economic growth would be harmful, and unemployment would continue to increase.</p>
                                                                            <p className="fs-18">Since many consider crypto coins a volatile investment during an economic crises, we expect to see their value decline further. Overall, market sentiments and economic conditions make it difficult for crypto to rebound. As the FED continues to hike interest rates, investors would turn to safe-haven investments instead of cryptocurrencies. </p>
                                                                        </p>

                                                                            <p>The bearish trends in the crypto market are not new since these digital assets are famous for their volatility. We have seen in the past how the market has experienced a bear run in challenging economic situations, such as the crash in 2018.</p>
                                                                            <p>However, the crypto market did rebound in the next few years and reached an all-time high in its market cap in 2021. But the recent loss in its value is quite significant since coins like Bitcoin have come close to breaking their resistance levels. Though the recession won't lead to the coin's demise, it is a significant setback. </p>
                                                                        </p>

                                                                        <p className="fs-18">
                                                                            <h4>New Innovations that Can Impact the Coin's Value </h4>
                                                                            <p>Innovation plays a critical role in mitigating the impact of recession in the long run. An example is the boom of the micro-gig economy and increased reliance on e-commerce after the 2008-09 recession. Since Blockchain is a new and innovative technology, we might see widespread adoption in this recession. </p>
                                                                            <p>Many industries have started using this technology to their advantage. Therefore, there is a chance that cryptocurrencies on the Blockchain would experience the same growth as people adopt this new technology.</p>
                                                                        </p>
                                                                        <p className="fs-18">

                                                                            <p>While coins like Bitcoin and Ether have a good chance of surviving the recession, the altcoins will not be as lucky. In the recent sell-off, various altcoins that saw a boom in their value have lost around 99% of their value. This decline led to massive losses for investors, and it is unlikely they will gain their confidence again.</p>
                                                                            <p>However, cryptocurrencies with optimal adoption rates are more likely to come on top after the recession. Coins like Ethereum will likely grow and survive the recession since they have a firm grip over the layer-one blockchain ecosystem. </p>
                                                                            <p>Nevertheless, a bearish market will negatively affect the value of digital assets in the coming months. Coins that don't have a high market capitalization, higher uncertainty, and dismissive liquidity are more likely to collapse.</p>

So, you might want to find out which currencies are more likely to survive a recession. Unfortunately, experts and analysts still find it difficult to predict a crypto coin's value. </p>
                                                                            <p>Industry experts believe that the top 20 cryptocurrencies might see some decline during the recession, but they can survive the tough times ahead. These crypto coins have a higher market capitalization and better historical price performance. However, it would help if you kept an eye on the latest trends and changing market situations to know how the crypto coins' prices will react.</p>
